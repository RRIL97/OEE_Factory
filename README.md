# OEE_Factory

Overall Equipment Effectiveness program.
-----


OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) is the gold standard for measuring manufacturing productivity. Simply put â€“ it identifies the percentage of manufacturing time that is truly productive. An OEE score of 100% means you are manufacturing only Good Parts, as fast as possible, with no Stop Time.


This project was coded for a big factory in ashdod and was meant to be used to preserve productivity within the factory.

This project required a lot of team work and was coded with the help of my sisters that study computer science.
Over all it took a week to code which included a lot of self learning, figuring how to interact with the new SQL server & numerous new libraries that we had to use in order to complete the task properly.
